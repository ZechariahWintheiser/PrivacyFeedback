# Privacy Customer Feedback System

A revolutionary privacy-preserving customer feedback platform built with **Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)** technology, enabling confidential feedback analysis without compromising user privacy.

## üîê Core Concepts

### FHE Contract Privacy Customer Feedback - Confidential Feedback Analysis

This system leverages **Zama's FHE technology** to create a privacy-first feedback collection and analysis platform. The core innovation lies in performing computations on encrypted data without ever decrypting it, ensuring complete privacy protection while still enabling valuable business insights.

**Key Privacy Features:**
- **End-to-End Encryption**: All feedback data is encrypted using FHE before being stored on the blockchain
- **Confidential Analysis**: Analytics are performed on encrypted data, never requiring decryption
- **Zero Knowledge Insights**: Business intelligence without revealing individual feedback details
- **Privacy-Preserving Aggregation**: Statistical analysis maintains complete anonymity

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

The platform consists of three main components:

1. **Smart Contract Layer** (`PrivacyFeedback.sol`)
   - FHE-encrypted data storage
   - Confidential computation engine
   - Privacy-preserving analysis functions

2. **Web Interface** (`index.html`)
   - User-friendly feedback submission
   - Real-time system status
   - Wallet integration for Sepolia testnet

3. **Blockchain Integration**
   - Sepolia testnet deployment
   - MetaMask wallet connectivity
   - Gas-optimized transactions
